 # Question 2
 
 Fascinated by the snowfall at Lakefield College School, you resolve to write an augmented-reality app that will use a phone's camera, and time-lapse photography, to track snowfall amounts for each day.
 
 ![snowfallatlcs](snowfallatlcs.png "Having fun with snow at LCS")
 
 The following pieces of information will be tracked each hour:
 
 * date of this measurement
 * time of this measurement
 * current height of snow outside window in centimetres
 
 Additionally, the app will keep track of, overall:
 
 * total snowfall over entire year so far
 
 For each piece of information above, create a variable or constant (whatever is more appropriate).
 
 Then, use `print()` statements to briefly explain why you chose to use a variable or a constant for each piece of information above.
