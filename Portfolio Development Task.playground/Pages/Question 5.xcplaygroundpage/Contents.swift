 # Question 5
 
 Imagine that you are trying to write an app that identifies an independent school based on a series of questions.
 
 The questions will be answered for you with either `true` or `false` and no other possible response.
 
 Three constants have been created below with certain values.
 
 Write an `if` statement that prints "Must be Lakefield!" when the values of the constants would seem to suggest the school is Lakefield, or otherwise prints "Hmm, need more data to be sure."

let hasWaterfrontOnLake = true
let hasBoysAndGirlsAttending = false
let hasGreenAndWhiteBuildings = true
